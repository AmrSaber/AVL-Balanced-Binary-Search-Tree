# AVL Balanced Binary Search Tree
The implementation of a balanced binary search tree (AVL tree) with C++, the tree is implemented as template map that supports any data types as key and value.

The implementation is divided into header file and cpp file, the cpp file is fully documented  
and the main file provides a very convenient interface for dealing with the tree.

This implementation was intended as a project for data structure course, but I found it too beautiful not to be published ^_^  
By the way, we got full mark + Bonus :D
