# AVL Balanced Binary Search Tree
The implementation of a balanced binary search tree (AVL tree) with C++

The implementation is divided into header file and cpp file, the cpp file is fully documented
and the main file provides a very convenient interface for dealing with the tree

This implementation was intended as a project for a data structure course, but I found it too beautiful not to be published :D
